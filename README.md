# All the forms you'll ever need can be formed here.

Formulator makes creating forms in React super simple by generating a form automatically based on certain array of object that can be further passed as props. We take cares of all the boring and repetitive stuff. The only thing you need to do is pass an array of objects that includes all the information about creating an element, such as the input label, input value, placeholder name, etc. The result is less code, fewer errors in form values, and less use of brain cells, which can then be put to better use elsewhere.
